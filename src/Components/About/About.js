				What is overflow? Everything in CSS is a box. You can constrain
				the size of these boxes by assigning values of width and height
				(or inline-size and block-size). Overflow happens when there is
				too much content to fit in a box. CSS provides various tools to
				manage overflow. As you go further with CSS layout and writing
				CSS, you will encounter more overflow situations. CSS tries to
				avoid "data loss" Let's consider two examples that demonstrate
				the default behavior of CSS when there is overflow. The first
				example is a box that has been restricted by setting a height.
				Then we add content that exceeds the allocated space. The
				content overflows the box and falls into the paragraph
